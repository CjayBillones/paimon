# Paimon Bot
Your number one travel companion in Genshin Impact.

Paimon is a discord bot that helps Genshin Impact players plan their farming routine, calculate their DPS, or get info from wiki among other useful commands.

## Development Setup

1. Download and install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/CjayBillones/paimon).
3. Create your own bot application in [discord](https://discord.com/developers/applications) so you can get your own bot token.
4. Create a `.env` file in the root folder of the project then add your own token.

```
# .env file

TOKEN = "<INSERT YOUR TOKEN HERE>"
```

5. Add your own bot to a discord server (you can make a dev server for testing your bots).
6. Run `node index.js` then check if the bot will go online in discord.
